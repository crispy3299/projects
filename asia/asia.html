			<button class="collapsible">Beijing</button>
			<div class="content">
			  <p>Beijing was a city like no other. Going in without a tour guide was very difficult. Pretty much no one spoke English, and the only people that spoke English was the front desk at our hotel. The Great Wall of China was about an hour and a half drive and the view was amazing. The troubling part were the steps as they go on forever and not all steps are the same height. There was at one point where we had to walk up 300 steps to reach the next tower. One of the best parts was a bobsled ride down from the top of the great wall to the bottom of the mountain.</p>

			<button class="collapsible">Shanghai</button>
			<div class="content">
			  <p>Shanghai was a very metropolitan area. Everywhere there were shops, entertainment, and people from different cultures which I did not expect. Even one night we attended a variety show where they spun plates on top of poles. The area was thriving with things to do, but we tried to make the most out of it.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Cambodia</button>
			<div class="content">
			  <p>Cambodia was different. Food was cheap, hotels were cheap, but once you get out of Siem Reap, you will truly appreciate what this country has to offer. We took a tour where we watched the sun rise over the Angkor Wat temple. The water reflects a mirror image of the temple. Each temple we went through (we went to five different ones), they each looked completely different from one another. There was even a temple with the center having a tree that had its stalk have a spider web type of look. Overall, this city/country is a site to behold. They also accept US dollars as a usable currency.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Vietnam</button>
			<div class="content">
			  <p>I would call Vietnam or Ho Chi Minh the city of motorcycles and scooters. Rarely there were any cars on the city streets. Also the way that these vehicles pass each other on an intersection is a sight to behold. Buildings in the city are small in floor space but built high. Best parts of the trip were little restaurants that open on the side of the street. You sit on small little chairs and tables and eat your pho with a nice cool beer.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Philippines</button>
			<div class="content">
			  <p>The Philippines is my family's homeland and have been there many times. Manila itself is a metropolitan city where there are too many cars and you can get from one place to another faster by foot though you should not do that. The best parts are getting away from the city and seeing the natural wonders that the Philippines brings. From seeing the volcano within a volcano, Taal, or laying back in one of the Philippines white beaches with clear blue water, it is worth the visits back. </p>
