                  <button class="collapsible">Chicago</button>
                  <div class="content">
                    <p>Chicago is a fun city to go to. On days though it could be quite humid. We visited quite a few museums and went to the Willis tower for a view of the city. They had amazing deep dish pizza and I would reccomend Giordano's to anyone who hasn't tried it yet. We also went to the navy pier where they had a small amusement park. A fun thing we did was take a night river cruise where they explained the history of Chicago and the skyscrapers that ran along the Chicago River.</p>

                  <button class="collapsible">New York</button>
                  <div class="content">
                    <p>New York has the hustle and bustle that can only be expierience in Manhattan. Skyscrappers are everywhere and historical monuments/museums are everywhere. From the Statue of Liberty, to Times Square, to riding a horse through Central Park, there is always something to do. If you want a relaxing evening or date night, watching a Broadway musical is one of the things to do. Most of the things we did though were going to the top floor of the highest buildings such as the Empire State Building, Rockafellar Center, and the One World Observatory. It is also amazing how the subway trains work and almost everyone takes them.</p>
                  </div>
                  <button class="collapsible">Denver</button>
                  <div class="content">
                    <p>Denver is like any other city, with a few exceptions. There can be one day where you can experience all four seasons. We were there and it hailed, rained, got really hot, then got really cold. Also Denver is a great place if you want to do outdoorsy stuff. We drove an hour and a half away and visited the Garden of the Gods. People there were hiking and mountain climbing, which was no easy task. We also visited the Red Rock Ampitheatre which was an outdoor concert venue inbetween two large pieces of red rock. Denver itself had the tradional aquarium, shopping streets, and variety of food.</p>
                  </div>
                  <button class="collapsible">St. Louis</button>
                  <div class="content">
                    <p>St. Louis was a place where you had to drive to get to places. The Arch was a sight to be seen. We went up the arch to the very top and the ride to get up there was itself an experience. We took a river cruise tour on the Mississpi River and took in a Cardinals baseball game. One of the best parts of St. Louis was going to the Zoo, which was free. The food there was good with the traditional barbeque and pie. Can't wait to go back there again.</p>
                  </div>
                  <button class="collapsible">Des Moines</button>
                  <div class="content">
                    <p>All I could say was there was a lot of farm land. When we were in the city, alot of it was closed as it was mostly a financial downtown. We did attend an Indian wedding there where the groom rode an elephant down their main street to the front of a hotel. Other than that it was a relaxing place it a lot of local life outside of the city.</p>
                  </div>
                  <button class="collapsible">Boston</button>
                  <div class="content">
                    <p>We were visiting friends in Boston. We toured both Harvard and MIT and they were huge campuses. One night we pretty much stayed there and played pool/video games in one of the teacher's lounges. It was very cold as we went there right after the winter season so snow was a little bit visible. New England clam chowder did help warm us. We also visited the Boston aquarium and took in a Red Sox game at Fenway park. Wind chill factor was present so we didn't stay too long at the game.</p>
